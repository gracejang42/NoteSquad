**Deployment**

To run the NoteSquad app you must have docker installed:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Currently using our project&#39;s amazon s3 bucket for storage but will probably be disabled after complete, check the .env file and input your own AWS credentials, create a bucket called &quot;notetakers&quot; and docker will read from this and use your bucket.
3. Navigate in a terminal to the Notesquad\_FinalDraft folder in the "All project code-components" folder.
4. Type the command docker-compose up in your terminal
5. It&#39;s ready to use when the terminal input says ...   

    **[nodemon] starting `node server.js`**   
    **web\_1 | http://localhost:3000**   
    **web\_1 | Seems all green!!**

1. To access the login page type **localhost:3000/** into your preferred browser
2. All pages should be accessible from the login.

**Testing**

1. **Initial Login and Registration:** From the login page, Don&#39;t have an account? Click here to sign up! should take you to the registration page. The registration page has 7 fields you should have to fill out before you can **Submit** the form:

    **Username, Name, Email, University, Password, Confirm Password, Account Type**

    There are indicators at the bottom of the page that should be red when the page loads. They check if your password has the following:

    **A lowercase letter**

    **A capital (uppercase) letter**

    **A number**

    **Minimum 8 characters**

    **Password and Confirm Password Match**

    **Special Character**

    They should turn green when all conditions are met and then the submit button becomes enabled.

1. **User Profiles:** Once you have satisfied all the conditions hit submit you should be able to see your user profile. Your information from the registration page should be visible in the **Profile Info** card at the edge of the screen. The **Tour** button should grey out the page and produce a small box above all the highlighted features explaining them. You can end the tour at any time by pressing _End Tour_. You can edit your Name, Email, and University sections of your Profile Info section by clicking **Edit Profile.** You can edit one or all of the fields and they will save and display appropriately.
2. **Uploading and Reporting Documents:** To upload a document press the **Upload File** button in the PDF upload block below Profile info. Enter your major and the Course ID. You can use only upper and lowercase letters and numbers. The Course ID cannot be more than 8 characters. If you try to upload a document other than a PDF, you should be redirected to a page that says **The file must be a PDF!** To return to your user profile simply hit the back button. You can view, download, and print your PDF with the **Preview/Download** button. To report it, click **Report**. After reporting a PDF, your page should refresh and the reported PDF should be removed. There is also a delete button that only allows the original uploader, or an admin, to delete the file from the database.
3. **Search:** You can search for notes via the search bar, by typing either the major (i.e. Computer Science, Math, Biology, etc.) or the course code (i.e. CSCI3308, MATH2033, etc.) or even partials. You can use spaces. The search bar is not case sensitive. Once you hit search you should be directed to another page with the search results. If there are no search results, you should still be redirected, the page will simply not contain any notes. To save the notes, click **Save**. That should automatically redirect you to your profile. If you don&#39;t want to save any notes, the **Home** button on the Navbar should bring you back to your profile if you&#39;re still signed in. If you are not signed in it takes you to the Login page.
4. **Admin Profile:** The login credentials for the admin profile are: admin@email.com password: admin1password. Once logged in, you should be able to see all the reported notes in the **Reported Notes** section. You can still preview the notes if you&#39;d like to look at them yourself, or you can delete them by clicking **Delete**. Once they are deleted, they should also be deleted from every user&#39;s saved notes.
5. **Logging in and out, and About:** To log out of any profile, click **Logout** on the Navbar. You can log back in with the correct email and password. If you provide incorrect login information, red text should appear just above the NoteSquad copyright saying &#39;_Invalid Credentials_&#39; . The **About** button on the navbar should redirect you to a page with the NoteSquad product description and Application Architecture Overview.
